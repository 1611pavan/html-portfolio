<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a BTech student passionate about applying computer science to solve problems. I'm currently focusing on honing my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and web development. Through DSA, I'm gaining a strong foundation in efficient code design and problem-solving techniques. In web development, I'm exploring the world of front-end and back-end technologies to bring ideas to life on the web. I'm eager to leverage my DSA knowledge to build performant and scalable web applications.</p>
